# BattleshipGame
Battleship is a two player game written in JavaScript. Before play begins, each player secretly arranges their ships on their primary grid. Each ship occupies a number of squares on the grid, arranged either horizontally or vertically. In each round, each player takes a turn to announce a target square in the opponent's grid which is to be shot at. The opponent announces whether or not the square is occupied by a ship. When all of the squares of a ship have been hit, the ship's owner announces the sinking of the ship. If all of a player's ships have been sunk, the game is over and their opponent wins.
